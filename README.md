What's not working: (2020.12.15)
   
   Airdrop
   
   Bluetooth
   
   USB fix (not done, i didn't creat my custom SSDT to fix my USB port, but it still can be used)
   
For CPU AIO Cooler control i recommand liquidctl (https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl), it works good on my CORSAIR Hydro Series H100i v2.
